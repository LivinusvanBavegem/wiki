# Docker
Here you can find a bunch of rebuild shell scripts to automatically stop, remove, update and rebuild containers (or if they dont exist just build them).

## Dependencies
These scripts only require ```sh``` and a standard ```docker``` install.
Some of them need the additional ```docker-compose``` package to work, they will have corresponding files in their folders.
If there is more to the configuration than just running the script and following a guided configuration, there is a guide aswell.
