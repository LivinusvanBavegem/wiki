# Nginx
The easiest way to configure and run nginx is [ncdt](https://github.com/nasourso/nginx-certbot-docker-tui) by nasourso.
So the first step is downloading it.

```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nasourso/nginx-certbot-docker-tui/master/src/ncdt.sh```

You can just run the script and it will install all needed dependencies.
After that just go ahead and start the container.
You can then configure reverse proxies by adding websites.
