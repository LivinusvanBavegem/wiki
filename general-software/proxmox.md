## PCI/GPU passthrough

To use GPUs or other PCI devices you need to work with PCI passthrough.
For documentation you can look in the [Proxmox wiki](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Pci_passthrough).
There is also an [article](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/b5xpua/the_ultimate_beginners_guide_to_gpu_passthrough) on reddit, that focusses especially on windows 10 VMs with GPU passthrough.
