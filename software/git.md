# Git

Git is probably the best version control system (VCS) there is.
It's easy and can be lightweight, but also has tons of possibilities for using graphical (/web) user interfaces.

## Git with web interface

Web interfaces for git are quite useful for easily showing code to other people.
Additionally it is easy to collaborate together.

- [Gitea](applications/gitea.md) is an open-source and selfhosted

## Git without graphical interface

If you don't need a bloated web-interface the a more [basic idea](applications/bare-git.md)
is probably what you're looking for.
