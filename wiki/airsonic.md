# Airsonic

[Airsonic](https://github.com/airsonic/airsonic) is a free and open-source
personal media streamer.
It is a fork of [Subsonic](./subsonic.md).
Airsonic is not maintained anymore and therefore deprecated.
A more modern implementation of it is
[Airsonic-Advanced](./airsonic-advanced.md).

## Server

A server can be setup via docker with the
[linuxserver image](./docker-images/linuxserver_-_airsonic.md).

## Clients

It is possible to use many different clients because the server is compatible
with all the Subsonic clients.
These can be found in the [Subsonic entry](./subsonic.md#clients).
