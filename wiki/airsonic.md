# Airsonic

Airsonic is a free and open-source personal media streamer.
It is a fork of [Subsonic](./subsonic.md) and thus is compatible with
most of its clients.

## Server

A server can be setup via docker with the [linuxserver image](./docker-images/linuxserver_-_airsonic.md).

## Client

As already mentioned it is possible to use a bunch of different clients because
the server is compatible with most of the Subsonic clients.

- [Ultrasonic](https://www.f-droid.org/en/packages/org.moire.ultrasonic) is a
  free and open-source android subsonic-compatible client.
- [Sonixd](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd) is a
  free and open-source cross-plattform subsonic- and jellyfin-compatible client.
  It uses a look and feel similar to the spotify client.
