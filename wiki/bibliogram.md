# Bibliogram

[Bibliogram](https://sr.ht/~cadence/bibliogram/) is an alternative frontend for
Instagram.
Please note that Bibliogram is now officially discontinued according to
[the developer](https://cadence.moe/blog/2022-09-01-discontinuing-bibliogram)
as it is not possible anymore to show user pages but only single posts.

## Server

A server can be setup via docker with the [cloudrac3r image](./docker-images/cloudrac3r_-_bibliogram.md).

## Automatic redirect from Instagram

There are various addons to redirect from Instagram links to your (or a public)
Bibliogram instance.
For Firefox for example there is
[privacy redirect](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-redirect/).
For Android there is
[the UntrackMe app](https://framagit.org/tom79/nitterizeme) (available at [f-droid](./android/f-droid.md)).
