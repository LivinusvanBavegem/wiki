well as instant messaging chats.

## Usage

This section addresses various features of Discord.

### Disable Automatic Update Checks

By default Discord performs an automatic check to see if it is up to date.
On [Linux](/wiki/linux.md)-based systems it can be disabled by adding `"SKIP_HOST_UPDATE": true` to
the `~/.config/discord/settings.json` file.
