# E-books

E-books are digital publications of books.
They can be read with specific hardware - an e-reader - or on a personal
computer.
E-books are usually available in `.epub` or `.pdf` files.
Amazon (`.azw`), Mobi (`.mobi`) and other brands selling e-readers have
proprietary formats.

## Management

The management of e-books can be achieved by using special software suites like
[calibre](/wiki/calibre.md).

## DRM

Proprietary formats may but don't have to feature DRM.
There are some software solutions for handling DRM like the no longer supported
[DeDRM by apprenticeharper](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools) or
its supported counterpart [DeDRM by noDRM](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools).
Due to legal issues it is recommended to not use these or similar software.
