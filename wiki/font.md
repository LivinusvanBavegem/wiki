# Font

A fonts is the particular size, weight and style of a typeface.
Operating systems based on [Linux](/wiki/linux/linux.md) handle fonts by the
[fontconfig package](/wiki/linux/font_configuration.md).

## Typefaces

Typefaces or font families can be roughly divided into the following styles:

- Serif typefaces use serifs - the small feature at the end of the strokes
  within letters.
- Sans-serif typefaces do not use serifs.
- Monospace typefaces are typefaces with all glyphs having the same width.

Depending on the usage and definition japanese, chinese and korean fonts can be
seen as a separate style.
