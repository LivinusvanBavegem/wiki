# Magic: The Gathering

[Magic: The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com) - often shortened to MTG or Magic - is a tabletop
collectible card game.
MTG is published by [Wizards of the Coast](https://company.wizards.com) - which are commonly
reffered to as Wizards.

## Resources

There are many useful resources.
The following list provides a select few of them.

- [cardmarket](https://www.cardmarket.com/) is a trading post for tabletop cards based in europe.
- [deckstats.net](https://deckstats.net/) gives the option to build and analyze MTG(A) decks.
- [Magic Judges](https://chat.magicjudges.org/mtgrules/) is a live chat with judges to clarify the
  rules.
- [MTG Desktop Companion](https://www.mtgcompanion.org/) is a collection manager for MTG that
  includes prices, stats and a deck builder, aswell as the option to import and export to most of
  the used MTG deck formats.
  It is free and open-source.
  Its source code can be looked at on their
  [GitHub Page](https://github.com/nicho92/MtgDesktopCompanion).
- [What's in Standard?](https://whatsinstandard.com/) lists the sets that are currently legal in
  the standard format.

## Playing Online

There is a fully digital and online version of MTG called
[Magic: The Gathering Arena](https://magic.wizards.com/mtgarena) - or MTGA for short - that has
nearly the same rules as the tabletop variant.
Another alternative to playing fully digital is [Magic: The Gathering Online](https://www.mtgo.com).

It is also possible to remotely play with tabletop cards.
This is most easily done on [Spelltable](https://spelltable.wizards.com/) which is an official
website by Wizards.
For playing Spelltable a [webcam](/wiki/webcams.md) is needed to be set up with a bird's eye view
over the playing field.
An alternative to a normal webcam is [DroidCam](/wiki/android/droidcam.md) for
[Android](/wiki/android.md) which is supported by the website itself.

Both Spelltable and MTGA use the same login credentials.
