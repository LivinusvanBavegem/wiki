# Steam Deck

The [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) is a handheld gaming
computer made by the same developers as [Steam](./steam.md),
[Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com).
Due to its form factor it can be used especially well to play games that need a
controller, such as many games that run on [emulators](./emulators.md).
But by adding a USB-hub and connecting keyboard and mouse it can be used to
play classical PC games aswell.
As the Steam Deck is using a linux based operating system all the windows based
games are run with the help of [Proton](./proton.md).
The Steam Deck includes the Flatpak based [Discover](../linux/flatpak.md)
software management suite to install additional software.
