# Steam Deck

The [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) is a handheld gaming
computer made by the same developers as [Steam](./steam.md).
Due to its form factor it can be used especially well to play games that need a
controller, such as many games that run on [emulators](./emulators.md).
But by adding a USB-hub and connecting keyboard and mouse it can be used to
play classical PC games aswell.

## Shortcuts

- Esc: `STEAM + D-Pad Left`
- Show Keyboard: `STEAM + X`
