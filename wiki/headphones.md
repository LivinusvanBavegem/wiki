# Headphones

Headphones are a pair of drivers that converts electronic signals into [audio](/wiki/audio.md).
Headphones are available in different forms: for example headphones and in-ear monitors.
All types are addressed in this article.

## Audio Profiles and Reviews

Headphones have different frequency responses.
[AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq/tree/master) can be used to normalize these to a
harman curve.
AutoEq also has a [website](https://autoeq.app/) on which headsets can be searched and equalizer
presets can be exported more easily.

An extensive list of in-ear monitor reviews was made by crinacle.
It is called [crinacle's ranking list IEMs & Earphones](https://crinacle.com/rankings/iems/).
A similar list for headphones was also made by crinacle.
