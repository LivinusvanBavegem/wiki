# Audio

Audio is an important point in a linux desktop environment

## Noise cancellation

Noise cancellation can be achieved by installing
[Noisetorch](https://github.com/lawl/NoiseTorch).
This works for `pulseaudio` and `pipewire`.
After the installation modify the `Voice Activation Threshhold` to your needs.
