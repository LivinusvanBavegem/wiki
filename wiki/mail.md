# Mail

Mail is not dead yet.
But most of the programs used to interact with them are total trash.
Nevertheless there are some really nice pieces of software to check out.

## Server

If you want to host your own mail-server there are solutions with and without interfaces.

- [Dovecot](dovecot.md) is a simple mail server that can be dockerized and has no interface.

## Client

If you don't have a built-in web interface for your mail-server you need some software to access your mails.
And even if you have it can be useful to keep your mails synced locally on your pc.

- [Neomutt](linux/neomutt.md) is a terminal-based mail client, that has a simple interface.
