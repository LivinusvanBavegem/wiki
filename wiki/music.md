# Music

Music is a nice to have on your system.
There are multiple different approaches on how to get it working depending on
your needs.
In general you need to consider if you want the music directly on your pc or
access a server for it.

## Server/Client

If you want to keep your system clean of much data, you can use this kind of setup.
There are differences depending on your preffered software interface.

- [Airsonic](./airsonic.md) is a free fork of Subsonic, can be dockerized and has
  a web-interface and multiple possible client options.

## Scan CDs

You can convert your CDs to files on your computer.
This way you don't have to search for your CDs all the time.

- [Exact Audio Copy](https://www.exactaudiocopy.de) for windows can rip music
  and automatically tag it with the help of a list of databases.
- [metaflac](./linux/flac.md) for linux is a programm
  to edit the tags of flac files from the command line.
  It is bundled in the `flac` package for debian and arch based systems.
- [MusicBrainz Picard](./picard.md) for linux is a
  graphical user interface for tagging files of many different formats.
