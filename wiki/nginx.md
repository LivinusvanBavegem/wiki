# Nginx

[nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) is a http reverse proxy.
An alternative solution for this, especially when used in combination with
[Docker images](./docker.md) is [traefik](./traefik.md).

## Server

A server can be setup via docker with a terminal user interface program for
nginx and certbot, which is called nginx-certbot-docker-tui or short ncdt.

Alternatively the standalone [nginx image](./docker-images/nginx.md) can be
used.
