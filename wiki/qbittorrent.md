# qBittorrent

[qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) is a cross platform free and
open-source [BitTorrent client](/wiki/bittorrent.md#clients).

## Setup

The software can be setup via [Docker](/wiki/docker.md) with the
[dyonr image](/wiki/docker/dyonr_-_qbittorrentvpn.md) that
includes an [OpenVPN](/wiki/vpn.md#openvpn) tunnel.

## Limiting  Upload and Download

By right clicking torrents a limit for the upload and download can be set.
Setting the limit to `0` and disable the upload/download at all is not possible.
The general upload and download can be limited under the tab `Speed` in the
`Options` under the `Tools` menu.

If a client is needed that diables upload or download completely another client
from the [bittorrent entry](/wiki/bittorrent.md#clients) should be used.
