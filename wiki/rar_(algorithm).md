# RAR (algorithm)

This article describes the [RAR](https://www.rarlab.com/) algorithm.
For the linux `rar` or `unrar` package see the
[rar package entry](/wiki/linux/rar_(package).md).

RAR - short for Roshal Archive - is an algorithm for compression aswell as a
format (`.rar`).
RAR archives can feature files with extensions of form `.r01`, `.r02`, etc.
These are parts of the compressed data that are created when the data is
compressed.
