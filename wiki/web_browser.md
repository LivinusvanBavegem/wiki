# Web Browser

A web browser is an application that is used for accessing websites.
Browsers often use [search engines](/wiki/search_engine.md).

## Setup

There are various web browsers that are used.
This article recommends the usage of [Firefox](/wiki/firefox.md) because it is
both widely supported and gives the posibility to configure many things to
provide a secure web browser.

## Usage

This section focusses on usage of web browsers in general or topics related to them.

### Making a Website into a Desktop Application

It is possible to create an [Electron-based](https://www.electronjs.org/) web application from a
website.
For this the open-source and free software tool [Nativefier](/wiki/nativefier.md) can be used.
